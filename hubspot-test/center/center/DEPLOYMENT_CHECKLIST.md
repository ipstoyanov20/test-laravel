- [ ] Authenticated with HubSpot (`hs auth info`)
- [ ] Project dependencies installed (`hs project install-deps`)

### 2. Configuration Verification

- [ ] `app-hsmeta.json` has proper app configuration
- [ ] Required scopes are configured
- [ ] Card metadata is properly set

### 3. Code Quality

- [ ] UI components are properly imported
- [ ] Error handling is implemented

### 4. Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] Proper scope limitations
- [ ] hubspot.config.yml not tracked in git

## üß™ Testing Procedures

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start local development server
hs project dev
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] App loads in HubSpot interface
- [ ] UI components render correctly
- [ ] Refresh functionality works
- [ ] Error states display properly

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Upload to HubSpot
hs project upload
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Upload completes successfully
- [ ] Build process succeeds
- [ ] Auto-deployment completes
- [ ] No build warnings (except known OAuth warning)

### Post-Deployment Verification

#### 1. App Installation
1. Navigate to: `https://app.hubspot.com/developer-projects/[PORTAL-ID]/project/center`
2. Verify app appears in developer projects
3. Install app if not already installed

#### 2. UI Testing
1. Go to a contact record in HubSpot
2. Look for "Custom Contact Analytics" card
3. Verify card displays properly
4. Test refresh functionality
5. Check responsive behavior

#### 3. Functionality Testing
- [ ] Contact ID is correctly retrieved from context
- [ ] Mock data displays properly
- [ ] Loading spinner appears during refresh
- [ ] Error handling works (simulate errors)
- [ ] All UI elements are clickable and functional

## üîç Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No contact ID found"
**Solution:** Ensure you're viewing the card on an actual contact record, not the contacts list view.

### Issue: Build fails
**Solutions:**
1. Check syntax errors in JSX files
2. Verify all imports are correct
3. Run `hs project install-deps` again

### Issue: Card doesn't appear
**Solutions:**
1. Ensure app is installed in your HubSpot account
2. Check that card location is set to "crm.record.tab"
3. Verify object types includes "CONTACT"

### Issue: Authentication errors
**Solutions:**
1. Re-run `hs init` to re-authenticate
2. Check private app scopes in HubSpot settings
3. Verify access token hasn't expired
